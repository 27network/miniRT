> A raytracer in C using a cursed graphics library and a severe lack of math knowledge.

## Project notice

This repository holds the code to our [rt](https://projects.intra.42.fr/projects/42cursus-rt) final project. However, the resulting binary is intended to be **fully** compatible with the [miniRT](https://projects.intra.42.fr/projects/minirt) common-core project's requirements and restrictions.

### Bonus functions

The bonus part of both projects allows usage of any function as long as it's reasonable and in scope; here's the list of bonus functions and their usage in the project:

| Function name    | Header file | Usage            |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| `pthread_create` | `pthread.h` | man it's threads |
